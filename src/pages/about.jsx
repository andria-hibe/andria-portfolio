      <IntroText>Hi, I&apos;m Andria. üå∑</IntroText>
      <AboutParagraph>
        I&apos;m a full-stack engineer who enjoys solving tricky problems and
        turning them into simple, useful products. I care about creating
        software that feels good to use and makes life easier for the people
        behind the screen.
      </AboutParagraph>

      <AboutParagraph>
        Before moving into tech, I worked in policy advocacy, marketing, and
        event management. These roles gave me a strong foundation in
        communication, strategic thinking, and stakeholder engagement. I still
        draw on those skills every day as an engineer.
      </AboutParagraph>

      <SectionHeader>A few things about me outside of work:</SectionHeader>

      <HobbiesList>
        üåä I love diving. It&apos;s a mix of calm and discovery that always
        leave me wanting more. Exploring underwater is one of my favourite
        things to do in the world.
        <br />
        üß∂ I&apos;m drawn to detail-oriented hobbies that reward focus and
        patience and you will often find me working on pottery, miniatures, and
        embroidery.
        <br />
        üèîÔ∏è I enjoy getting outdoors to hike, surf, and ski whenever I can. These
        activities push me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible and I
        love a good adventure!
        <br />
        üåø I&apos;m slowly filling my home with plants until it looks and feels
        like a jungle. If I wasn&apos;t a software engineer, I would probably be
        a horticulturist.
        <br />
        üìö I love reading books from all over the world. There&apos;s something
        magical about how stories can transport you into completely different
        worlds and perspectives.
        <br />
        üç´ I&apos;m a decent baker, it&apos;s one of my favorite ways to relax
        and it makes my home feel extra cozy.
      </HobbiesList>

      <AboutParagraph>
        At the heart of it, I love creating things, whether that&apos;s a piece
        of software, a ceramic bowl, or something fresh out of the oven.
        I&apos;m curious by nature and enjoy learning new skills, solving
        problems, and finding better ways of doing things.
