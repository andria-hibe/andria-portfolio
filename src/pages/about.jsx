      <AboutParagraph>
        I'm a full-stack engineer who enjoys solving tricky problems and turning
        them into simple, useful products. I care about creating software that
        feels good to use and makes life easier for the people behind the
        screen.
      </AboutParagraph>

      <AboutParagraph>
        Before moving into tech, I worked in policy advocacy, marketing, and
        event management. These roles gave me a strong foundation in
        communication, strategic thinking, and stakeholder engagement. I still
        draw on those skills every day as an engineer.

      <SectionHeader>A few things about me outside of work:</SectionHeader>

      <HobbiesList>
        üåä I love diving. It's a mix of calm and discovery that always leaves me
        wanting more.
        <br />
        üß∂ I'm drawn to detail-oriented hobbies that reward focus and patience
        and you will often find me working on pottery, miniatures, or
        embroidery.
        <br />
        üèîÔ∏è I love getting outdoors to hike, surf, and ski whenever I can.
        <br />
        üåø I'm slowly filling my home with plants until it looks and feels like
        a jungle.
        <br />
        üìö I love reading fiction from all over the world and the way it gives
        me a glimpse into another way of life.
        <br />
        üç´ I love baking, it's one of my favorite ways to relax and it makes
        home feel extra cozy
      </HobbiesList>

      <AboutParagraph>
        At the heart of it, I love creating things, whether that's a piece of
        software, a ceramic bowl, or something fresh out of the oven. I'm
        curious by nature and enjoy learning new skills, solving problems, and
        finding better ways of doing things.
